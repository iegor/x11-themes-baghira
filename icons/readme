Due to licensing stuff (mainly conflicts with debian free software) and as i could not reach Timur until today (onexige seems to be dead) i temporary removed his icons and replaced them with some svg stuff i created somewhen much earlier.
You can still download and include timurs icons from http://www.kde-look.org and hopefully i can reinclude them in future releases.

Thomas
